        <p>This is the temporary website of Hannah Gibson. She is fascinated with brand strategy, creative technology and design. She is happiest when concepts move into new and unconventional spaces. Currently she is working as a senior brand creative at <a href="https://www.up.com.au/">Up</a>, a new digital bank in Aus. She designed the Up website amongst other things that will hopefully be updated here soon.ðŸ˜˜ Get in contact with me via email
